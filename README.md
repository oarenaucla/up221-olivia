### About Me
+ Born and raised in Houston, Texas :capricorn: (family roots in New Orleans & the *Texas* Valley) :cowboy_hat_face:
+ Went to UT Austin (hook 'em :metal:) and witnessed the rapid and devastating change of Austin 
+ Motivated to learn how urban planning could combat displacement, authentically engage communities, preserve cultures of resistance, and promote sustainability :cityscape:	
+ Moved to Washington, DC :classical_building: to work on place-based housing + community development projects and recognized the importance of neighborhood-level data and a more expansive understanding of "data" to include narratives/storytelling
+ Went to graduate school to learn better ways to do ^ all of the above :memo: :thought_balloon:

### Projects this Quarter
+ Now -> interested in approaches to preserving and protecting communities facing displacement :fist_right:, exploring equitable + accessible + vibrant public urban green spaces :national_park:, alternative models of housing :houses:, the role of art :art: 
+ This space will include code that uses spatial data science to explore these themes and challenge traditional planning "techniques" and "knowledge" 
+ Potential topics could include identifying opportunities for community-controlled housing (vacant parcels/city-owned properties/commercial spaces/CLT), identifying communities facing displacement, identifying the harmful impacts of existing policies (41.18, zoning constraints, lack of TOPA), exploring opportunities to reconfigure streets to balance parking, public space, small business/"informal economy" opportunities, and pedestrian-focused transit

### Larger Objectives
+ Adding mapping and spatial visualization to a toolkit of creative ways to share narratives and explore conceptions of urban justice
